# Predicting Customer Behavior Using Different Machine Learning Models 

## Abstract:
This repository contains code, data, and step by step directions on how to implement the code. We created different types of models to train our data and compared the accuracy scores of each one at the end. Our data contains instances of customers entering a website that tracks if they purchase something or not. It also keeps tracks of the reason for entering a website, if it was during a weekend/holiday, and many other factors that we could use to predict whether a customer will make a purchase on the website. We implemented a decision tree model, random forest model, logisitic regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and a Support Vector model. We thought these models gave us the best range of options to predict our data. In the end, we were able to look at all the accuracy scores for each model which allows us to choose the best method to predict our dataset.
